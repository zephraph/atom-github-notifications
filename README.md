# Github Notifications for Atom

This package allows you to see your if you have any awaiting GitHub notifications on atom's status bar. It's not in active development at the moment, but I respond quickly to PRs. Feel free to pitch in!

### Installation

Install from the settings view in atom or by apm via

```
apm install github-notifications
```

### Usage

1. Create a new [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with _only_ notifications access.
2. Copy the token into the package's settings
3. Enjoy the notifications

**Warning: There is no way to secure your github token from other packages. Make absolutely sure you _only_ configure your personal token to allow notifications access.**
